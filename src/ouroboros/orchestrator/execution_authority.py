"""Finite execution-authority identity for the AC runtime.

Foundation A deliberately identifies a small, explicit component boundary. It
does not attempt to derive authority from an arbitrary Python callable graph:
closures, globals, descriptors, module monkeypatches, caches, and runtime
handles are volatile. A custom verifier can therefore be bound only to its
exact live object for this process; it is never made portable by introspection.
