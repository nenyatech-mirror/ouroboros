"""Atomic leaf prompt assembly for :class:`ParallelACExecutor`.

Extracted verbatim from ``ParallelACExecutor._execute_atomic_ac`` (work order
R4). This module owns the prompt/task-section assembly portion of an atomic
leaf dispatch: label/indent derivation, the governed task section, the success
contract block, the retry/parallel-awareness sections, the working-directory
scan, and the completion-instruction contract. The behaviour is unchanged — the
executor delegates to :class:`AtomicPromptBuilder` and receives the same prompt
it used to build inline.
