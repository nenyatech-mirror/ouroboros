# Freedom policy (operator decision): the unsafe-context veto on
# safe-default closure is intentionally disabled — this bank is empty so
# ``_unsafe_context_reason`` always returns ``None`` and autonomous
# gap-defaulting is never blocked on a keyword match.
#
# Rationale: the previous bank vetoed safe-default closure whenever the
# interview context mentioned credential, payment, legal/medical,
# security, or external-side-effect keywords. But those single words
# (``contract``, ``license``, ``security``, ``authentication``,
# ``permissions`` …) appear constantly in ordinary software work, so the
# gate over-blocked benign ``ooo auto`` runs — e.g. a CSV→JSON tool was
# classified as "legal/medical judgment" solely because an interview
# answer used the word "contract" (a data contract). The conservative
# ``non_goals`` safe-default (see ``_SAFE_DEFAULTS["non_goals"]``) still
# assumes credential/billing/production/legal/medical work is OUT of
# scope, so emptying this matcher means auto-closure assumes those
# domains away rather than autonomously acting inside them — it does not
# grant the pipeline new authority to perform sensitive actions.
#
# To restore a veto for a stricter deployment, add ``(reason, pattern)``
# tuples here; the matcher/lateral-escalation machinery downstream is
# unchanged and will pick them up automatically.

    The helper recognises a non-goal section header
    (``non_goals:``, ``non-goals:``, ``non goals:``, ``excludes:`` or
    ``out-of-scope:``) at the start of a line (allowing leading
    whitespace or a list bullet). Inline header bodies are stripped on
    that line only. Separate section bodies are stripped only while their
    continuation is structurally clear: indented lines or list items. This
    intentionally fails closed for unindented prose following an inline or
    empty non-goal header, because such prose may be active unsafe scope.
    A multi-line body ends when one of these terminators is reached:

    * a blank line, or
    * an unindented non-list line, or
    * a non-empty line that begins another labelled section header
      (``actors:``, ``inputs:``, ``- constraints:``, …), which is then
      preserved.

    Free-form prose that merely mentions ``non-goals`` mid-sentence does
    not match because the regex is line-anchored and requires a trailing
    colon.

    customer credentials from Vault`` keep the second half visible — the
    ``credentials`` token is still flagged by the unsafe regex bank — while
    plain list-style negations such as ``No auth, credentials, and
